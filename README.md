# Data Structures

Data structures implemented in TypeScript.

## Data Structures

In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

-   [Stack](src/stack) - a linear data structure that follows LIFO principle;
-   [Queue](src/queue) - a linear data structure that follows FIFO principle;
-   [Linked List](src/linked_list) - a singly linked list
-   [Doubly Linked List](src/doubly_linked_list) - a doubly linked list;
-   [Hash Table](src/hash_table) - a lookup table, key is hashed and resulting hash indicates where the corresponding value is stored;
