# Linked List

In computer science, a **linked list** is a linear collection of data elements, in which linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence. Under the simplest form, each node is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. More complex variants add additional links, allowing efficient insertion or removal from arbitrary element references. A drawback of linked lists is that access time is linear (and difficult to pipeline). Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible. Arrays have better cache locality as compared to linked lists.

Some of the basic operations performed with **linked list** are:

-   **Insert**: insert a node into the linked list
-   **Delete**: delete a node from the linked list

The insertion and deletion each can be done in different ways:

-   **Beginning**: Insert at the beginning (prepend) or Delete from the beginning of the linked list.
-   **End**: Insert at the end (append) or Delete from the end of the linked list.
-   **Position**: Insert at or delete from a specified position.

Moreover, there are different other methods such as:

-   **Search**: search for an item in the linked list.
-   **Reverse**: Reverse the linked list.
-   **toArray**: returns an array representation of the linked list.
-   **toString**: returns a string representation of the values in the linked list.
