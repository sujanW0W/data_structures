# Doubly Linked List

In computer science, a **doubly linked list** is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains three fields: two link fields (references to the previous and to the next node in the sequence of nodes) and one data field. The beginning and ending nodes' previous and next links, respectively, point to some kind of terminator, typically a sentinel node or null, to facilitate traversal of the list. If there is only one sentinel node, then the list is circularly linked via the sentinel node. It can be conceptualized as two singly linked lists formed from the same data items, but in opposite sequential orders.

Some of the basic operations performed with **doubly linked list** are:

-   **Insert**: insert a node into the doubly linked list
-   **Delete**: delete a node from the doubly linked list

The insertion and deletion each can be done in different ways:

-   **Beginning**: Insert at the beginning (prepend) or Delete from the beginning of the doubly linked list.
-   **End**: Insert at the end (append) or Delete from the end of the doubly linked list.
-   **Position**: Insert at or delete from a specified position.

Moreover, there are different other methods such as:

-   **Search**: search for an item in the doubly linked list.
-   **Reverse**: Reverse the doubly linked list.
-   **toArray**: returns an array representation of the doubly linked list.
-   **toString**: returns a string representation of the values in the doubly linked list.
