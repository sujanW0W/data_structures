# Queue

A **Queue** is a particular type of abstract data type or collection in which the entities are kept in a particular order. The queue has two ends: **Rear** end is through where entities are added, while **Front** end is through where entities are removed from the queue.

Basically, Queue is a type of linear data structure that conforms the FIFO principle. In a FIFO data structure, the element that is first added into the queue, will be removed first.

The basic operations in the queue are:

-   **Enqueue**: addition of element into the queue through rear end.
-   **Dequeue**: removal of element from the queue through front end.

Some other methods are:

-   **isEmpty**: Checks if the queue is empty.
-   **size**: Returns the size of the queue.
-   **toArray**: Returns an array representation of the queue.
