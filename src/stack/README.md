# Stack

A **Stack** is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations:

-   **push**, adds an element to the collection.
-   **pop**, removes the most recently added element that has not yet been removed.

In other words, stack is a linear data structure that follow LIFO principle. The order in which elements are added into and removed from the stack gives rise to the name, LIFO (Last In First Out). Stack has a single end through where elements are pushed or poped, and this end is called **top**.

Moreover, there are different other methods such as:

-   **peek**, access the top-most element of the stack without modifying the stack. If stack is empty, it retuns NULL.
-   **isEmpty**, checks if the stack is empty.
-   **size**, returns the size of the stack.
-   **toArray**, returns an array representation of the stack.
